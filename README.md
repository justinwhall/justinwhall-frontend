# Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

This is the viewlayer of my personal site [justinwhall.com](https://justinwhall.com) built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Backend is WordPress. [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org) handles the deploy to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) S3 where it's finally distributed by CloudFront. This happens whenever I publish a page, post etc - thanks to WordPress hooks and a bit of code.

 Like it? Hate it? Wanna chit chat ðŸ¤—? [Drop me a line.](https://justinwhall.com/contact/)
